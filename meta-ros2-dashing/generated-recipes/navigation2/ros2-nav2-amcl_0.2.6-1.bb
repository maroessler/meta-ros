DESCRIPTION = "<p>       amcl is a probabilistic localization system for a robot moving in       2D. It implements the adaptive (or KLD-sampling) Monte Carlo       localization approach (as described by Dieter Fox), which uses a       particle filter to track the pose of a robot against a known map.     </p>     <p>       This node is derived, with thanks, from Andrew Howard's excellent       'amcl' Player driver.     </p>"
