DESCRIPTION = "TRAC-IK is a faster, significantly more reliable drop-in replacement for     KDL's pseudoinverse Jacobian solver.      The TRAC-IK library has a very similar API to KDL's IK solver calls,     except that the user passes a maximum time instead of a maximum number of     search iterations.  Additionally, TRAC-IK allows for error tolerances to     be set independently for each Cartesian dimension (x,y,z,roll,pitch.yaw)."
