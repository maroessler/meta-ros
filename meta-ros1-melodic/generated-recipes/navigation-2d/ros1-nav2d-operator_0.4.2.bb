DESCRIPTION = "The operator is a lightweight, purely reactive obstacle-avoidance     module for mobile robots moving in a planar environment. The operator node     works by evaluating a set of predefined motion primitives based on a local     costmap and a desired direction. The best evaluated motion command will be     send to the mobile base."
